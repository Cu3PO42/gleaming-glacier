This config was heavily modified by me, but originally written by [FelixKratz](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/), who made their code available under the terms of the GPLv3.

Additionally, the following files where derived from other repositories:

* `items/applemusic.sh`, `plugins/applemusic*` were originally adapted from FelixKratz' dotfiles by [hunterliao29](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12#discussioncomment-4406700)
* `plugins/stats/*` were adapted from [khaneliman's dotfiles](https://github.com/khaneliman/dotfiles)
* `items/ical.sh`, `plugins/ical.sh` were published by [EphraimSiegfried](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12#discussioncomment-4730516)

I make no claims as to the licenses under which these particular files are available.
