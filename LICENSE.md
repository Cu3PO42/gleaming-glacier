# License

Unless otherwise noted, all code in this repository is available under the terms of the [GPLv3](./LICENSE_GPL3) or, at your option, by any later version of the GPL released by the Free Software Foundation and approved by [@Cu3PO42](https://github.com/Cu3PO42).
By contributing to this repository, you agree to also license your code under these terms.

This repository also contains bits and pieces of configuration from other people's dotfiles and other repositiories that they have shared on GitHub.
Such code is marked either by a comment in the file itself or an accompanying `LICENSE` file, describing the license that the relevant code is available under.

Some of this code was shared by the authors without a specified license.
I do include this code here, because I believe it is in the spirit of these dotfile repositories to share and learn from each other.
(And - legally - the GitHub Terms of Service permit other users to share code that was released as part of a public repository on GitHub.)
If, however, you are the author or otherwise have claims on one such piece of code contained in this repository and want it removed, please contact me and I will do so.
