title: Flake Outputs
---

# Flake Outputs

This Flake contains modules for building NixOS, nix-darwin, and Home-Manager configurations, these configurations themselves, packages, as well as themes for my [Chroma theming system](/features/chroma).

The structure of these outputs is defined by the [Gleaming Autoload](/features/gleaming-autoload) module.
It populates all of the Flake's outputs by reading the files contained in the repository.

This document contains a possibly incomplete list of all the elements included in this Flake.
It does not document any of the options introduced by these modules.
Right now, you will need to check the source code of my modules for these options.
However, I plan to generate documentation pages at some point in the future.

::: info
The majority of my configurations are seperated into what I call *feature modules*.
While they can be toggled on and off and may occasionally have their own options, they are fundamentally my configurations and not necessarily for generic use.
They are a great option if you simply wish to copy my configuration, however.

To enable a feature module, set `copper.feature.<name>.enable = true`.
Unless enabled they have no effect, so are safe to include by default.
For convenience (and legacy reasons), there is also an option `copper.features` that can be set to a list of feature names that will be enabled.

### nix-darwin Modules

* `chsh`: can be used to set the shell of an existing user. This is useful because `users.users` can only be used to manage the shell of newly created users; this also contains a thin wrapper that works around a race condition when using FileVault
* `neo2`: sets up the Neo2 keyboard layout
* `default-user`: sets up the option for a username that is used in various other locations, for example for the user that will own the final Homebrew installation

#### Features

* `apps`: installs Desktop apps I commonly need
* `base`: configures Nix settings
* `cli`: settings that concern themselves with the command line. Currently: `sudo` via Touch ID and indexing for `nix-search`

* `keyboard`: sets up my keyboard, in particular installs Neo 2 and sets key repeat settings
* `known-hashes`: nix-darwin will not overwrite some required files unless it knows they are in a 'default' configuration. This adds hashes for additional known defaults

* `orb-builder`: configures a {aarch64,x86_64}-linux builder via NixOS running in [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev)
* `wm`: installs yabai, Sketchybar, and skhd

### Common Modules

* `copper-mage`: a module to set up [Mage](/features/mage) for easy configuration of secrets
* `copper-patches`: a helper to apply patches to `nixpkgs`. By setting `copper.patches.<pkg>` to any list of patch files, an overlay is created that uses `overrideAttrs` on `<pkg>` to add the specified patches

### Flake Modules

* `allow-unfree`: configures the Nixpkgs instance used by the Flake to allow unfree packages
* `autoload`: automatically populates Flake outputs from the file hiererachy; see [the dedicated page](/features/gleaming-autoload)
* `base`: contains base settings recommended for all Flakes
* `copper-chroma`: configures the Flake outputs for [Chroma](/features/chroma)
* `copper-config`: defines outputs for configurations for other modules, including [Plate](/features/plate) and [Mage](/features/mage)
* `copper-mage`: adds type definitions for my [Mage](/features/mage) configuration
* `copper-plate`: adds configuration scripts necessary for use of [Plate](/features/plate)
* `default-overlays`: generates two overlays as an output. Particularly `additions`, which adds a namespace to nixpkgs of the same name as the namespace of your Flake, containing all of its packages and legacy packages. And `flake-inputs`, which adds `${namespace}-inputs` containing the package or legacyPackages for all Flake inputs
* `gleaming-modules`: instantiates all of the [Gleaming modules](#gleaming-modules) and adds the resulting modules to the Flake's outputs
* `gleaming`: configures common options for Flakes based on Gleaming Glacier
* `inherit-copper`: relevant only for configurations derviving from mine; adds all of my modules and feature modules to your configurations

### Templates

* `system`: A Flake that can be used to define your own system and user configs based on the frameworks introduced in this flake.

I plan to also keep templates for the development of projects in various languages here.

### Packages

For a list of packages, see [the dedicated page](./packages).

### Apps

* `bootstrap`: a wrapper srcipt used to activate configurations for the very first time. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for usage examples
* `generate`: templates a new host or user configurations. Set [Getting Started](#getting-started) for its usage.
* `set-hostname`: sets the hostname of the current system. Abstracts over various systems, such as macOS, Linux with systemd and Linux without systemd

# Gleaming modules

There are also a number of modules that are useful not only to my configuraton, but to any configuration based on Gleaming Glacier.
Thus, they can be instantiated for every Flake based on its namespace.
They are defined in the `gleaming/` folder and are seperated by the system for which they are intended.
Like normal modules, there is also a common option.

### Home-Manager Modules

* `file`: an abstraction layer used for linking or copying config files. By default, files are linked from the Nix Store, making it easier to switch back to previous generations, but they can also be linked to the location of the repository by setting

### Common Modules

* `features`: a trivial helper that allows setting `${namespace}.features = [...]` instead of a number of `${namespace}.feature.<name>.enable = true`. This exists mainly for legacy reasons.
```
copper.file.symlink = {
  enable = true;
  base = "/path/to/repo";
};
```
* `per-system`: a helper module to make it more easy to access any packages coming from your own Flake in your own configurations. It allows you to write `${namespace}.packages.yourpackage` rather than having to write `origin.self.packages.${pkgs.hostPlatform.system}.yourpackage`. Additionally, it allows to build those packages not with your Flake's global nixpkgs instance, but rather the one from your configuration.
