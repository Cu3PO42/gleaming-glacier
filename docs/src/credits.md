# Credits

These dotfiles reuse parts of various others' configurations and are inspired by many more.

In particular, configuration from the following repositories was used:

* [FelixKratz' dotfiles](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/) from which I initially copied the skhd, yabai and SketchyBar config, available under the terms of GPLv3
* [ghostx31's dotfiles](https://github.com/ghostx31/dotfiles) whose Wezterm config I am using
* [hunterliao29's Apple Music plugin for sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12#discussioncomment-4406700)
* [khaneliman's dotfiles](https://github.com/khaneliman/dotfiles) from where I took some sketchybar configuration
* [yuanw's nix-home](https://github.com/yuanw/nix-home) which is the origin of my icalBuddy derivation
* [EphraimSiegfried's Calendar plugin for Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12#discussioncomment-4730516)
* [Prasanthrangan's Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots/) which is the origin for many of my Hyprland-related configurations licensed under the terms of GPLv3

Additionally, I learned a lot from these repositories, listed in no particular order:

* [Misterio77's Flake](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config)
* [MatthiasBenaets's Flake](https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets/nixos-config/tree/master)
* [Pimey's Flake](https://github.com/pimeys/nixos)
* [alodborrero's templates](https://github.com/aldoborrero/templates/tree/main/templates/blog/nix/setting-up-machines-nix-style)
* [alexghr's Flake](https://github.com/alexghr/nix)

Special thanks also go to the creators of the various tools and programs that I use in my configuration.
